The equation is logit($\pi$) = 0.68192 -1.29461 * `deparmentEnglish` -1.26260 * `deparmentHistory` -3.30648 * `deparmentPhilosophy` -0.04340* `deparmentPhysics` -1.73931 * `deparmentPsychology` -0.09987 * `genderMale`, where indicator variables are equal to 1 when their corresponding condition is true and 0 otherwise.

# Question2
## a.
```{R}
x1 <- x[-1]
x1$yes_prob<- predict(fit0,type = "response")
x1 <- unique(x1)

library(tidyverse)
q2_a <- x %>%
  group_by(deparment, gender, Admitted) %>%
  summarise(
    total = n()
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(deparment, gender),
              names_from = Admitted ,
              values_from = total) %>%
  rename(Yes = `1`,
         No = `0`) %>%
  mutate(total = Yes + No) %>%
  left_join(x1) %>%
  mutate(expect_count_Yes = yes_prob*total,
         expect_count_No = (1-yes_prob)*total,
         residual_yes = Yes - expect_count_Yes,
         residual_no = No - expect_count_No)
q2_a
      
```

## b.

There are two insignificant factor `genderMale` and `departmentPhysics`. To fit the two categories well, the residual of the predict values for other factors in the model enlarges.

```{R}
#The cells for Department Business Administration seem fit bad. The difference between the number of male and female applicants is the largest, and the difference of admission ratio between male and female is the largest. As a result, the expected data from this department yield the largest difference from the true value after averaging.
```

## c.

```{R}
HLTest = function(obj, g) {
 # first, check to see if we fed in the right kind of object
 stopifnot(family(obj)$family == "binomial" && family(obj)$link == "logit")
 y = obj$model[[1]]
 trials = rep(1, times = nrow(obj$model))
 if(any(colnames(obj$model) == "(weights)")) 
  trials <- obj$model[[ncol(obj$model)]]
 # the double bracket (above) gets the index of items within an object
 if (is.factor(y)) 
  y = as.numeric(y) == 2  # Converts 1-2 factor levels to logical 0/1 values
 yhat = obj$fitted.values 
 # browser()
 interval = cut(yhat, unique(quantile(yhat, 0:g/g)), include.lowest = TRUE)  # Creates factor with levels 1,2,...,g
 Y1 <- trials*y
 Y0 <- trials - Y1
 Y1hat <- trials*yhat
 Y0hat <- trials - Y1hat
 obs = xtabs(formula = cbind(Y0, Y1) ~ interval)
 expect = xtabs(formula = cbind(Y0hat, Y1hat) ~ interval)
 if (any(expect < 5))
  warning("Some expected counts are less than 5. Use smaller number of groups")
 pear <- (obs - expect)/sqrt(expect)
 chisq = sum(pear^2)
 P = 1 - pchisq(chisq, g - 2)
 # by returning an object of class "htest", the function will perform like the 
 # built-in hypothesis tests
 return(structure(list(
  method = c(paste("Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test with", g, "bins", sep = " ")),
  data.name = deparse(substitute(obj)),
  statistic = c(X2 = chisq),
  parameter = c(df = g-2),
  p.value = P,
  pear.resid = pear,
  expect = expect,
  observed = obs
 ), class = 'htest'))
}

```
```{R}
HLTest(fit0,g = 10)
```

The test statistic is $\chi_{HL}^2 = 14.815$ and p-value is 0.06284, which is larger than 0.05. Thus, with 95% confidence interval, we can conclude that the model does not fit bad and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the expected counts fitted by the model fitted in Problem and each cell in the contingency table.
 
# Question3

## a.

```{R}
fit3 = glm(Admitted ~ deparment * gender, data = x, family = binomial)
summary(fit3)
```

The equation is logit($\pi$) = 1.5442 -2.1662 * `deparmentEnglish` -2.2046 * `deparmentHistory` -4.1250  * `deparmentPhilosophy` -0.04340* `deparmentPhysics` -2.7013 * `deparmentPsychology` -1.0521 * `genderMale` + 0.9701 * `deparmentEnglish`:`genderMale` +1.1770 * `deparmentHistory`:`genderMale` + 0.8632 * `deparmentPhilosophy`:`genderMale` +0.8321 * `deparmentPhysics`:`genderMale` + 1.2523 * `deparmentPsychology`:`genderMale`, where indicator variables are equal to 1 when their corresponding condition is true and 0 otherwise.

```{R}
library(lmtest)
lrtest(fit0, fit3)
```

Since the p-value is 0.001144, which is smaller than 0.05. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the model with the interaction situation between department and gender fits the data better.

The CI of AG conditional odds ratios in 
department Business Administration is 0.1661733 and 0.6711405, which the estimated admission for male is between 0.1661733 and 0.6711405 times than for female in department Business Administration. Since 1 is not within the confidence interval, we can conclude that with 95% confidence interval, the admission rate of male is less than the female in this department.

The CI of AG conditional odds ratios in 
department English is 0.6203044 and 1.3685539, which the estimated admission for male is between 0.6203044 and 1.3685539 times than for female in department English. Since 1 is within the confidence interval, we cannot conclude that with 95% confidence interval, the admission rate of male is different from the female in this department.

The CI of AG conditional odds ratios in 
department History is 0.7742924 and	1.6529059	, which the estimated admission for male is between 0.7742924 and	1.6529059 times than for female in department History.Since 1 is within the confidence interval, we cannot conclude that with 95% confidence interval, the admission rate of male is different from the female in this department.

The CI of AG conditional odds ratios in 
department Philosophy is 0.3660608 and	1.8566740, which the estimated admission for male is about 0.3660608	and 1.8566740 times than for female in department Philosophy.Since 1 is within the confidence interval, we cannot conclude that with 95% confidence interval, the admission rate of male is different from the female in this department.

The CI of AG conditional odds ratios in 
department Physics is 0.2282466	and 2.4246334, which the estimated admission for male is between 0.2282466 and	2.4246334 times than for female in department Physics.Since 1 is within the confidence interval, we cannot conclude that with 95% confidence interval, the admission rate of male is different from the female in this department.

The CI of AG conditional odds ratios in 
department Psychology is 0.7160358	2.0598950	, which the estimated admission for male is between 0.7160358	2.0598950	times than for female in department Psychology.Since 1 is within the confidence interval, we cannot conclude that with 95% confidence interval, the admission rate of male is different from the female in this department.

# d.

Except department Business Administration, gender does not have a significant impact on departmentsâ€™ admissions decisions. In department Business Administration, the admission ratio of male is lower than the female.

# Question4

## a.

```{R}
male.rate=512/313
female.rate=89/19
total.rate=(512+313)/(89+19)
male.rate
female.rate
total.rate
```

Yes, in the department Business Administration row of the data, the number of admitting for male is only 1.635783 times than male are not admitted, while there is 4.684211 times for female admitted compared with female not admitted. However, The total number of male applicants is 7.638889 times higher than the total number of female applicants.The reverse of the admission rate and the number of applicants also shows in Physics department. The advantage in admissions ratio disappears under the large difference of the number of applicants. When the departments are combined, Simpson's paradox occurs.

# b.

The lawsuit alleged that female applicants were unfairly admitted at a lower rate compared to male applicants. However, we only find that gender does not have a significant impact on departmentsâ€™ admissions decisions except the department Business Administration(the ratio of female student admission is larger than the ratio of male students). Berkeley should realize that they have an imbalance in the number of male and female students they admitted. To avoid the lawsuit, the university should either expand the number of women admitted to the department of Business Administration or the department of Physics, and level up the bar of male admitted in these two departments; or narrow the number of female admitted in other four departments, and enlarge the number male admitted in other four departments to achieve gender balance.
